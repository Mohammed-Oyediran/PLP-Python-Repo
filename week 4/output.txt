LENA FOUND AN OLD KEY BURIED IN HER BACKYARD.  
CURIOUS, SHE SEARCHED UNTIL SHE DISCOVERED A HIDDEN TRAPDOOR.  
INSIDE, SHE FOUND A DUSTY CHEST FILLED WITH LETTERS FROM DECADES AGO.  
ONE LETTER WAS ADDRESSED TO HER, PREDICTING SHEÂ€™D FIND THEM TODAY.  
SHIVERS RAN DOWN HER SPINE AS SHE READ ABOUT CHOICES SHE HAD YET TO MAKE.  
JUST THEN, HER PHONE RANGÂ€”A NUMBER SHE DIDNÂ€™T RECOGNIZE.
