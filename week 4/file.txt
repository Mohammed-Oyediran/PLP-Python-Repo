Curious, she searched until she discovered a hidden trapdoor.  
Inside, she found a dusty chest filled with letters from decades ago.  
One letter was addressed to her, predicting she’d find them today.  
Shivers ran down her spine as she read about choices she had yet to make.  
Just then, her phone rang—a number she didn’t recognize.
